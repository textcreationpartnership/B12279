            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And (saith <hi>Marrow</hi>) it is said properly of the multitude that assemble themselues in such disorderly sort for their common quarrels. As if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of a Township doe assemble to pull downe a hedge or pale, to haue Common where they ought to haue none, or to beate a man that hath done them some publike of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or displeasure.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:177909:4"/> generally by any vnlawfull Assembly: Howsoeuer it be, two things be common both to Rout, Riot, and vnlawfull Assembly; the one that three persons at the least, bee gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together; for so it is commonly taken at this day, as I haue learned: the other that they being together, doe breed disturbance of the Peace, either by signification of speech, shew of Armour, turbulent gesture, or actuall and expresse violence, so that either the peaceable sort of men bee vnquieted and feared by the fact, or the lighter sort &amp; busie bodie embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the example.

            <p>The Civilians call it <hi>Caetum, vel Turbam,</hi> which we call an unlawfull assembly, defining it in these words: <hi>Turba est quae consistit ex mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudine hominum ad malt cujusquam perpetratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem congregatorum;</hi> and this multitude must be of fifteene, or tenne at the least. <hi>Praetor de vi bono rapt.</hi> §. 1. <hi>Et Barthol. ibidem.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, the Constitutions and Customes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Countries doe restraine this to a lesser number: as to foure in Burgundy, <hi>Chassaneus de Consuetud. Burgum rubri</hi> 13. §. 6. And it is a private offence to any person, &amp; lyeth <hi>civiliter ad duplum</hi> only, within the compass of the first yeare: and <hi>ad simplum</hi> afterwards for any thing lost, or other harme incidently befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; or <hi>in quadruplum,</hi> for any thing taken away by any of the tumult. But it is also pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished criminally, as a publike offence done to the Commonwealth, and against the peace. And first if the force be done without armes, it is called <hi>vis privata,</hi> and punished by the third part of his goods that causeth it, and by infamy that depriveth him of all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:177909:5"/> either to become a Senatour, or a Decurian, or a Iudge, or other Honourable person, or Officer. If it be with armes, then it is termed <hi>vis publica,</hi> and is punished in the intention no lesse than in the effect, <hi>per depor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationem,</hi> that is, perpetuall banishment, if he be a freeman; or by death, if slaughter be committed: If he be a servant, then by death simply. The Saxons punish it at this day <hi>per fastigationem, vel manus amputationem.</hi> But three things here be accessarily incident. First, that the force raised be greater than may bee resisted by him against whom it is intended, without other helpe. Next, that the force be <hi>vis armata,</hi> that is, <hi>quae fit adhibitis armis:</hi> the third, that there be <hi>dolus,</hi> that is, a pretended malice, or setled intention to harme. <hi>Gayl. de pace Pub. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>The reason why the intention in this case is reputed an effect, is because it is reckoned <hi>inter atrociora delicta:</hi> In the which, for the extraordinary regard of the publike estate, <hi>conatus perinde atque effectus punitur. Gayl. ubi supra cap.</hi> 13.</p>
